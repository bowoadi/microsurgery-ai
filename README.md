# Research Code for Microsurgery Skill Analysis

This repository contains scripts for preprocessing and training 3DResFuz learning models for analyzing microsurgery skills using video data.

## ðŸ“Œ What This Code Does
- **Preprocessing**: Converts raw surgical video data into frames for model training.
- **Model Structure**: Implements 3DResFuz model (`micro_model.py`) for classifying or evaluating surgical expertise.
- **Model Training**: Code for training a 3DResFuz model for surgical skill classification
